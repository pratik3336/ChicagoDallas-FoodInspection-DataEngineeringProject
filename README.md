## Tools Used

- **ER Studio/Navicat:** For data modeling and database design.
- **Talend:** To handle the ETL process efficiently.
- **Alteryx:** For data preparation and analytics.
- **Python:** Scripting for data analysis and automation of the ETL process.
- **SQL Server (Local):** Main database for staging and integrating data.
- **MySQL:** Used for certain datasets requiring a different SQL environment.
- **Power BI & Tableau:** For data visualization and generating insightful reports.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Analysis:** Begin with an in-depth analysis of the datasets to understand their properties and the insights they can provide.
2. **Documentation:** Document the findings and create a mapping document to guide the ETL process.
3. **Staging the Data:** Use SQL Server and MySQL for staging the data, ensuring it is correctly formatted and ready for transformation.
4. **Cleaning Data:** Employ Alteryx and Python scripts to clean the data, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
5. **Loading Data:** Load the cleaned data into an integration schema in SQL Server, preparing it for analysis.
6. **Generating Reports:** Utilize Power BI and Tableau to create reports and dashboards that offer actionable insights based on the integrated data.
